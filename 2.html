 <h2>UX is not UI</h2>
 <img src="uxui.jpg" width="50%">
 <p>User Interface Design is not the same as User Experience.</p><p>UI is the end result of UX. UI is what people will see and touch. UI is what results when effective UX is considered. If you have good user interface design,
    it is a direct result of the research and thoughtfulness you have placed within the UX process.</p>
